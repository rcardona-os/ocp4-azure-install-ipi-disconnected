# Example: "existing_infra_rg" refers to an already existing resource group in Azure.

# Specifies the name of the existing Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure to host infrastructure services.
# VNets provide logical isolation for Azure resources and enable communication between resources.
# Example: "existing_infra_vnet" is the pre-configured VNet for this deployment.

# This is crucial for internal cluster communication and services.
# Example: "ocp-private.com" serves as a private DNS domain name for OpenShift.
